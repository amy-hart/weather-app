# HartWeather

HartWeather is a weather app built using React, and the Manchester Codes weather API. 

I completed this project during my time as a student on the Manchester Codes part-time coding bootcamp. This project helped me to get to grips with React, unit testing, and getting to grips with fetching external data from APIs.
